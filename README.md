# Hi, I'm Loukas 👋

🎯 Junior Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer based in Toulouse, France  
I recently completed a Data Science diploma (RNCP level 7 – CentraleSupélec x OpenClassrooms) and I’m actively looking for my first role in Data Science / Machine Learning.

I love building end-to-end ML projects that solve real business problems.
